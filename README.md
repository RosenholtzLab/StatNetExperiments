## StatTexNet

This is the implementation for the paper "StatTexNet: 
Evaluating the Importance of Statistical Parameters for Pyramid-Based Texture and Peripheral Vision Models"

This algorithm is for

* Generating synthetic datasets through the Heeger and Bergen texture synthesis method
* Performing statistics importance analysis through Contrastive Learning and weight/shapley feature selection
